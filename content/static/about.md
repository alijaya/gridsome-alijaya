Hi! My name is Ali Jaya Meilio Lie, but you can use *alijaya* because it's my internet name.

I'm passionate about many stuff, here are the shortlist of the things that I like:

* Filmmaking
* VFX
* Programming
* Game Design
* Web Design
* Crafting
* Education

# Competitive Day

I was born in capital of *Indonesia*, Jakarta, but soon I moved to and grown up in *Bangka Island*. So I identified myself more with Bangkanese culture.

In my early education journey (elementary, junior high, and senior high school), I participate in several *math and programming competition*. In the meantime, I learn how to do *game programming* by myself with the help of the internet.

# Filmmaking Journey

Then after my senior high school, I swerved my path to a *filmmaking* journey. I took a filmmaking 1.5 years course in *SSR Jakarta* (School of Sound Recording Jakarta).

After that, I do some *freelancing*, *interning* (Agate Studio), *volunteering* (TOKI, Tim Olimpiade Komputer Indonesia), and working as *visual effects artist* in 2 Indonesian features films (Garuda Superhero and Rudy Habibie).

# French Life

Bored with working life, I decided to continue my study in *France*. I take 7 months French course in IFI Thamrin, Jakarta Institut FranÃ§ais d'IndonÃ©sie.

Then I studied for 3 years in *UniversitÃ© Grenoble Alpes*, majoring in *Arts du Spectacle / Performing Arts* in *Grenoble, France*. When I was studying, I was quite active in organisation, especially in *PPI Grenoble* (Perhimpunan Pelajar Indonesia Grenoble).

# Life Now

In these days, I went back to *Jakarta, Indonesia*, and tries my fortune here. I have a plan to make my own production house. But the road is still long, and it would be great if you can give support and join me along the way ðŸ˜€. I'll try to give back to the world with sharing some useful content with you guys.

And feel free to contact me, I might be a stranger to you, but I'm still a human that will be excited if there's a genuine email that enter my box ðŸ˜€.
