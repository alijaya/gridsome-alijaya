  I don't know what will this post about.

  But yeah, I'll start to write something 

  to cover up that I don't have any real content here.

  So I'll tell you about my life now.

  It's pretty busy, even if I don't have any formal work now.


  Why is that?


  Because I try to do many thing at once, and nothing is finished.

  So, if you see [my profile](/about), you can tell 

  that I'm a *jack of all trades*.


  Is it a good idea to be a jack of all trades?


  No idea. But so far, I pretty like it.

  My mind just can't focus in one thing, when I do something, 

  even that thing is my hobby, my mind just says *that something else* 

  seems more interesting. And when I do *that something else*, my mind 

  says that *that other thing* seems more interesting.


  And the loop keeps happening.


  If we can make an analogy, my mind just want to work in *Breadth-First Search*

  mode. It's pretty slow to finish one branch of the project, but I will try all the possibility.


  So what am I doing now?

  * maintaining this website for one ðŸ˜¢

  * organizing some event

  * making new video for [my new youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCikF7WM18Z3tJn_JVp2OehA)

  * helping my friend's shooting

  * doing some freelancing stuff (VFX stuff)

  * attending wedding (oh my god... it makes me self-conscious ðŸ˜¢)

  * building my own bussiness


  Yeah... seven at a time...


  What I really want is... I just want to finish my next video for my youtube channel.

  And building my own bussiness, try some stuff.


  And maybe you wonder why I update my website now.

  Because I got distracted... I should continue my video now...


  Ok then... this post becomes weird...


  So yeah...
